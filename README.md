Installation
Connect the components according to the circuit diagram in the "circuit-diagram.png" file.
Upload the "self_balancing_robot.ino" file to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
Usage
Turn on the power supply for the robot.
Wait for the MPU6050 sensor to initialize (the LED on the Arduino board will stop blinking).
Place the robot on a flat surface and it should balance itself.
Use a remote control to move the robot forward, backward, left, and right.
